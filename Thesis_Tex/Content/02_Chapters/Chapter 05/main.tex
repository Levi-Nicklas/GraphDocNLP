\chapter{Conclusion}

Though applying several different methods in conjunction with one another (skip-grams, graph kernels, and clustering), unsupervised clustering can be done on text while preserving as much of the rich information from the original text as possible. \\
The NHTSA results, and their clusters, can be used to inform other research initiatives of similar scenarios for ambulance crashes. Identifying these clusters, providing summarized results, like n-gram graphs and term frequency/inverse document frequency lists, allows for information about similar crash reports to be compiled. This compiled information can then be used to generate more "edge-case" scenarios for Florida Polytechnic University's Autonomous Mobility Institute and their work on autonomous vehicles; rare cases are not always available in the datasets used to train autonomous driving models, and this kind of research could help inform their decision making moving forward.\\
The reddit thread dataset, was just too large for these methods to be applied to all observations in the dataset. This problem will need to be addressed in future work. The large samples ($N=1000$) used in the study here were accelerated through use of parallel programming and made this analysis possible. The analysis showed that ...
