\chapter{Future Work}

Future developments on this project would be focusing on adapting the methods to scale on high performance computing (HPC )environments. The methods currently do no do well as the number of graphs for comparison grows. While the methods do fairly well as the size of the graph scales up, the issue of many graphs needs to be addressed for application at scale. \\
Additionally, supervised learning methods could be explored on these datasets. Use of support vector machines in conjunction with these methods is well documented. Once the datasets are labeled, it would be an easy study to complete. The NHTSA data set, with only 48 observations, could be labeled with a number of different dependent variables that could be gleaned from the crash reports.The reddit thread dataset, as large as it is, may be a good candidate for a semi-supervised application. The clustering results from this study could be applied in a supervised application on reddit threads from the same subreddit, and efficacy could be assessed. \\
Lastly, these methods we used with edge histogram kernels exclusively, because they are computational cheaper than other methods, and exploration of the other kernel methods which utilize edge/vertex labels would be an important study to conduct.
