\section{Graph Kernels for Similarity}

The resulting graph kernel matrix, with dimensions $n \times n$, is high dimensional data. We can take this kernel and perform a principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the high dimensionality of this data. Each row, can be considered as an observation, and each column as it's similarity value or in the $j$-th graph's dimension. PCA then allows us to express the data in a lower dimensionality, hopefully in 2 or 3 dimensions which can be visualized much better. \\
Then,
