\chapter{Results and Analysis}


\hspace*{0.3cm} Hierarchical Clustering was performed on both of the reddit and NHTSA datasets. These clustering methods lend themselves to be used with similarity/distance matrices, and the results shown here can be displayed in a variety of formats. One can learn more about the clustering results through dendrograms, n-gram graphs, and term-frequency/inverse document-frequency.
