\begin{abstract}

Unsupervised learning methods are applied to text data after applying modern graph based methods as preprocessing. Two datasets, technical reports on ambulance crashes from the NHTSA and social media threads from a reddit forum on mental health, are preprocessed into graphical representations. The graphical representations of the document can then be compared using modern graph kernel methods. The result of applying graph kernels is a matrix of similarity that can be used to perform hierarchical clustering. The datasets both differ in their writing style and their size; the NHTSA documents are large documents ($N=48$) and the reddit threads are often small but there are many ($N=1000$). Both datasets are analyzed with the methods described, and their results are compared.
