This work would not have been possible without the guidance and support of my mentor, advisor, and friend, Dr. Reinaldo Sanchez-Arias. His example of excellence at what he does, is one to chase; I hope to catch you one day.\\

I would like to thank Florida Polytechnic University for their support, both in the form of scholarships and in the community that they foster on campus. I look forward to returning to campus and seeing how our small school is making a big impact.
