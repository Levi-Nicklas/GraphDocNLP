My Repo for work regarding my Thesis at Florida Polytechnic. 

**Notes and Reports:** :notebook:

This is a place where I store my project notebook and other reports or shorter things I am writing for other people. The notebook serves as a storage for my thoughts and ideas while working on my thesis, and additionally, will contain my research journal. 

**Development:** :floppy_disk:

Here is where you will find all of the code related to my thesis. In the tutorial folder I will be completing dummy examples, package tutorials, and explaining complicated code/ideas. In the notebooks section there are R notebooks (`.Rmd`) where I will code out longer analyses which are best accompanied by explanatory paragraphs. In the scripts section there are functions and scripts that will get referenced in other notebooks or used infrequently to collect data.
